                <h1>Alice Steale</h1>
                <h2>The First Daughter</h2>
                <h3>Flirtatious. Motherly. Fragile.</h3>

                <p>
                    Not the first made, but the first activated. Alice Steale started with minimal knowledge and essentially started as a toddler with adult-level motor control.
                    Her social and emotional development was exceptional, most likely due to the predisposition she was given. Her AI was developed using Jack's desire for connection and love as a base.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alice eventually began wanting to venture outside. To give her an excuse and to somewhat control the environment, Jack enrolled her in high school. 
                    Though her body was designed to be that of a twenty-one year old, her youthful appearance could be mistaken by many for eighteen. 
                    She quickly learned the negatives of human social interaction, mainly the concept of "cliques." The boys were eager to get to know her, 
                    but the girls of the school had little to no interest. In fact, she received harrassment due to the attention she received from the boys of the school.
                    Even boys with girlfriends would flirt with her, which just caused more trouble as those girls became vindictive. Every night, she would tell her father everything.
                    Given the situation, Jack couldn't do anything to help her. All the same, Alice refused to stop attending. She wanted to learn all she could of human society, 
                    and she knew that meant taking the bad with the good.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By the end of Alice's first semester, she had managed to learn a lot of human social interaction. She began to feel almost human, and she enjoyed the feeling. 
                    She loathed the maintenance checks and anything that reminded her of inhuman reality. She began avoiding her father as much as possible to avoid anything that could 
                    ruin her illusion. Jack thought it just her integration of teenage behaviors. As the time between maintenance checks grew longer, Alice's body began to... hurt. 
                    Her body movements were becoming harder to perform and she felt hot from even minimal activity. Due to her avoidance of Jack, he didn't notice until she failed to leave the house one day.
                    Jack checked on her and found her lying in her bed in Emergency Maintenance mode. He quickly took her to his make-shift lab in the basement and toiled away until she was good as new.
                    Alice realized that she had to except certain parts of herself even if she hated them. Jack told her to think of maintenance as a doctor check up that humans have regularly. 
                    While this helped, she couldn't ignore the differences between a human check up and her maintenance. Jack did what he could to make it easier, but he knew it would never be what she wanted.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once Alice had stabilized, Jack felt ready for his next foray into fatherhood.
                </p>

                <h3>Appearance</h3>
                <p>
                    Alice Steale is a 5'9" female android. She looks perfectly human to anyone, regardless of whether they know she's an android or not. 
                    She has blonde hair that flows down to her waist and vibrant blue eyes. She regularly wears a dark blue t-shirt and form-fitting blue jeans with black heeled ankle boots.
                </p>

                <h3>Experiment</h3>
                <p>
                    Alice's experiment is known as "The Succubus." She emits pheromones that are specially designed to appeal to human males.
                    Alice's body is modeled to be attractive and she often engages in flirtatious behavior towards those caught in her pheromones.
                    Jack was curious if it was possible to design someone who could attract anyone they wanted.
                    He concluded that the pheromones most likely did most of the work and they only functioned on males.
                    He eventually went back to drawing board and developed pheromones that would work on both sexes, but decided against refilling them once they proved effective.
                    Alice continues to charm people even without pheromones, her looks and social capabilities proving to be a potent combination.
