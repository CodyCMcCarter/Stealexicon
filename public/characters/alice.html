                <h1>Alice Steale</h1>
                <h2>The First Daughter</h2>
                <h3>Flirtatious. Motherly. Fragile.</h3>

                <p>
                    Jack Steale was a child prodigy. He was told he could do anything he wanted when he was older. As a teenager, he wanted to fall in love.
                    He tried and he tried, but he struck out every time. His disdain for humanity didn't make it any easier. A bunch of primates squandering their intelligence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He gave up. Jack hide away in his room, sad and lonely. Until he realized... he could do anything. If he couldn't find a woman, he could MAKE one.
                    He began researching everything he would need to start his project. Androids? Not a thing yet. Drones? Too primitive. Robots were on their way, 
                    but not far enough yet. Maybe biology? He'd learn everything about the human body and convert it to machine. Even Biology wasn't where he wanted it to be though. 
                    He'd need artificial intelligence as well. This was a severely malnourished field. Maybe Psychology instead? Also too far behind. Of course he'd have
                    to do all the work himself. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Jack began studying both biology and psychology in great depth. He learned all that was known, then dug deeper. He used technology to learn more
                    about the mind and body, bringing them together to discover all there was to know. Once his understanding was complete, he converted it to machine.
                    Converting the human mind to artificial intelligence was no easy feat, but he succeeded in the end. The human body was another matter, as some elements
                    had no machine equal. He did the best he could, though it wasn't perfect. As he worked, he began to activate the AI he created. He taught it all he knew.
                    They would stay up late into the night talking as Jack toiled away on the AI's body. He made it perfect. Well, perfect to him. The AI, after much thought,
                    identified as female and wanted a name. Jack called her... Bella.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The long-awaited moment came. It was finally time to fuse mind with body. The AI needed to be shut down in order to import into the body's brain.
                    They their short goodbyes before Jack shut her down and transfered her into the body. All he had to do was finish powering it up and flip the switch...
                    Just... flip the switch. Why couldn't he do it? What stopped him? He fought with himself for what felt like hours, though it was meer minutes.
                    He couldn't do it. He couldn't bring something into the world that would be slave to his desires. He left Bella lying on the table in the basement
                    and went upstairs. He stared outside, realizing there was no good answer for his problem. He heard a giggle. His vision dropped and he saw a father 
                    playing with his child. Wait... that's it. Parents create children. He could create a child too. He could even skip the baby stage. He rushed off to
                    begin immediately.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So began the Steale family.
                </p>
